    "# Theory supporting what we are asked to do in the Problem Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM postulates that positive (negative) exposure to market risk is the only reason why a stock pays a return that is on average higher (lower) than the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobel laureate Prof. Robert Merton extends this theory to a dynamic context, using stochastic calculus. He shows that in a multiperiod context, not only market risk, but also exposure to factors that drive the level or slope of the Capital Allocation Line, is compensated by a risk premium. That theory is called Intertemporal CAPM or I-CAPM for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to let you financial data science work be guided by economic theory, it is worthwhile to follow the thinking of the I-CAPM. Namely, a systematic risk factor that is not the market factor needs to drive level or slope of the Capital Allocation Line (risk-free rate or Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio). \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem set can be rephrased: Are innovations to volatility driving daily changes in the Capital Allocation Line? If so, then exposure to volatility innovations are compensated by a risk premium. Hence, we rely on the Fama-MacBeth method and on volatility innovations extracted from a SVM to answer this question.\n",
